        <h3>Hello, I am Francesco and welcome to my portfolio</h2>
            <p>I am a trainee web developer currently on an exciting journey to become a web developer. As I continue to hone my skills and knowledge in this dynamic field, I am excited to share my journey and growth through this portfolio.</p>

            <p>Here, you'll find a showcase of the projects I've developed during an intensive 12-week bootcamp. These projects reflect the practical experience I've gained and my dedication to learning web development.</p>
            
            <p>The purpose of this portfolio is not only to display my work but also to connect with like-minded professionals, potential employers, and anyone interested in collaborating.</p>
