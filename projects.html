                    <h1>Portfolio Webpage Project</h1>
                    <h2>Project Description</h2>
                    <p>During my bootcamp, I developed a personal portfolio website to showcase the projects I completed throughout the program. The primary goal of this project was to create a visually appealing, user-friendly platform where visitors can view my work and easily contact me.</p>
                    <p>I used <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> to build and style the main content of the webpage, ensuring it was responsive and accessible across various devices. The design focuses on clean, modern aesthetics with a layout that highlights my completed projects, each accompanied by descriptions and links to view the source code.</p>
                    <p>For the contact section, I implemented <strong>JavaScript</strong> to perform client-side form validation, enhancing the user experience by ensuring correct data is submitted before the form can be processed. This feature ensured that visitors could easily reach out with inquiries or feedback.</p>
                    <h2>Key Features</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Project Showcase:</strong> A dedicated section highlighting individual projects completed during the bootcamp, each including descriptions, technologies used, and links to GitHub repositories.</li>
                        <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The portfolio is designed to be compatible across different screen sizes using media queries, ensuring accessibility on both mobile and desktop devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interactive Contact Form:</strong> JavaScript is used for real-time form validation, providing instant feedback to users about form input errors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Main Challenge</h2>
                    <p>The biggest challenge was building an <strong>interactive and user-friendly website from scratch</strong>. It required careful planning to structure the site’s navigation intuitively and design an engaging user interface. By iterating through several design prototypes, I was able to create a polished and functional final product.</p>

                    <h1>Weather API Web App</h1>
                
                    <h2>Project Description</h2>
                    <p>The objective of this project was to create a simple web-based weather application to demonstrate my understanding of asynchronous JavaScript. The project retrieves real-time weather data from an external API and displays it to the user. It served as a learning opportunity to work with <strong>Promises</strong> and <strong>try-catch</strong> blocks for error handling.</p>
                
                    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>CSS</strong>: For styling the app and ensuring a user-friendly interface.</li>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: For handling the API calls, managing the data asynchronously, and implementing error handling with <strong>try-catch</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h2>Key Features</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>City-based Weather Search:</strong> Users can input a city name to retrieve current weather information, including temperature, humidity, and conditions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Real-time Weather Data:</strong> The app fetches live data from a public weather API and updates the display accordingly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Includes error handling to manage failed API requests and invalid user inputs using <strong>try-catch</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h2>Main Challenge</h2>
                    <p>The main challenge was efficiently handling asynchronous requests to the API and managing various errors such as invalid inputs and network failures. Understanding how to work with <strong>Promises</strong> and implementing proper error handling with <strong>try-catch</strong> helped overcome these obstacles.</p>
