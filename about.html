        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="bio">
            <p>Hello, I'm Francesco, a passionate and curious web developer in training. My journey into web development started out of a desire to build solutions that make a difference. I've always been drawn to the blend of creativity and problem-solving that coding offers, and it's this combination that motivates me to keep learning every day.</p>
    
            <p>Before diving into web development, I explored different fields, but I quickly realized that technology and design were where my heart truly lies. Enrolling in an intensive 12-week bootcamp has been a transformative experienceâ€”one that pushed me to step out of my comfort zone and helped me gain hands-on experience with real-world projects. From designing user interfaces to implementing responsive designs and optimizing performance, each project has been a chance to learn, grow, and overcome challenges.</p>
    
            <p>What excites me most about web development is the constant evolution of the field. I enjoy the fast pace, the continuous learning, and the sense of accomplishment that comes from solving problems with code. Whether it's writing clean, efficient code or working on a team to bring an idea to life, I'm committed to improving my skills and staying at the forefront of industry trends.</p>
    
            <p>Outside of coding, I love exploring new technologies, tinkering with side projects, and collaborating with others who share my enthusiasm for creating. I'm also a firm believer in the power of community, and I enjoy exchanging ideas and learning from others in the field.</p>
    
            <p>In the future, I aim to specialize further in web development, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me. I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and connections, so don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to work together or chat about anything tech-related!</p>

            <p>Below, you'll find the programming languages I've been working with during the bootcamp. If you'd like to see how I've applied these skills, be sure to visit my Projects section. </p>
